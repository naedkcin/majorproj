Final version of my major project

To use this code - 1. Open terminal and install homebrew: ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
                   2. After that, type: brew doctor (this makes sure the directory is working properly)
                   3. Next type: brew install node
                   4. After you have completed that step: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
                   5. Then: export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node"
                   6. Then: export PATH="/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH"
                   7. Then: echo $PATH
                   8. Finally: brew install mongodb
